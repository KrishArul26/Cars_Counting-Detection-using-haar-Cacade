Cars detecting and counting using openCV
# For vehicles detection (car and bus), we can use the OpenCV to recognize and categorize vehicles using some of the haar cascade pre-trained model. 
# Installation of OpenCV
# pip install OpenCV-python 

# How to run the code
git clone git@github.com:KrishArul26/Cars_Counting-Detection-using-haar-Cacade
cd opencv-car-detection-video
# For vehicles detection for videos fil
python vehicle_video_detection.py.py
# For vehicles detection and counting for images
