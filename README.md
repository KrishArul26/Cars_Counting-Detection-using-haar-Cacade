# Cars Detection-using-haar-Cacade
Cars detecting and counting using openCV
### For vehicles detection (car and bus), we can use the OpenCV to recognize and categorize vehicles using some of the haar cascade pre-trained model. 

# How to run the code

git clone git@github.com:KrishArul26/Cars_Counting-Detection-using-haar-Cacade
cd opencv-car-detection-video
pip install -r requirements.txt
  ### For vehicles detection for videos fil
  python vehicle_video_detection.py
  ### For vehicles detection and counting for images 
  vehicle_count_detection.py
